## Overview
Welcome to our advanced Building Height Estimation project using monocular remote sensing imagery! This project employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the U-Net architecture to estimate building heights. Users can input an image, and the system will generate predictions for the heights of structures within the scene.

## Problem Statement
In urban planning and remote sensing, accurately estimating building heights is crucial for various applications. This project aims to provide a solution to this challenge by leveraging deep learning techniques to estimate building heights from monocular remote sensing imagery.

## Solution
Our solution involves a pre-trained U-Net model with swin transformer block that processes input images, producing predictions for building heights. The model is trained on a curated dataset to ensure accurate and reliable estimations.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing:** Utilizes OpenCV for image loading, color space conversion, and resizing.
- **Deep Learning Model:** The U-Net architecture for accurate and efficient building height predictions.
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib is employed to showcase the input image and model predictions side by side.
